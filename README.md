📘 Python Code Assignment

This Python assignment 📂 covers a wide range of basic to intermediate programming concepts. It includes working with data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries 📊, and also focuses on operations such as finding duplicates, reversing data, filtering values, and modifying collections. The assignment includes practical file handling tasks 📄 like reading a text file, overwriting its contents, counting characters, and printing lines in reverse order. Programs like generating the Fibonacci series 🧮 and finding anagrams 🔀 are also included to build logical and algorithmic thinking.

All code is modular, clean, and well-commented ✍️ to ensure readability and ease of understanding. The file handling part works with my_file.txt 📁, which is created or overwritten by the code. Scripts like reverse.py 🔁 help in manipulating file content in reverse, showcasing real-world text processing.

To run the programs, just make sure Python 🐍 is installed on your system and execute the files using a terminal or any Python IDE. Each script is self-contained and demonstrates clear use of loops, conditionals, slicing, and functions. This assignment is an excellent start for anyone looking to strengthen their core Python skills and get hands-on experience with fundamental programming patterns. 💡
